#RESUME WEB PAGE README (You aren't supposed to be reading this actually)

I'm just trying to get employers to see my LinkedIn and think, ‘Damn, this guy seems like a solid IT guy—I should hire him.’
I hope it's working… is it?

(And yeah, maybe making a whole résumé website when I already have a PDF and a fully filled-out LinkedIn profile isn’t the most necessary move...
But hey, I worked hard on all of them, so at least I’m consistent!)
