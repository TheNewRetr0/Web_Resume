                    Hello, I'm Oscar Luna.<br><br>
                    I'm a Mechatronic Engineering student and a Technical High School graduate specialized in Programming, with knowledge in tech support, hardware installation, networking, and preventive maintenance.<br><br>
                    I'm passionate about technology and continuous learning, which is why I'm currently pursuing certifications and self-taught education alongside my college studies in Mechatronic Engineering.<br><br>
                    I've worked as an assistant in systems and technical services departments, providing user support, installing over 50 devices, and offering troubleshooting assistance. I'm currently expanding my professional portfolio with specialized courses and hands-on experience.<br><br>
                    I'm seeking opportunities that allow me to keep growing professionally, apply my skills, and continue learning.
                </p>
